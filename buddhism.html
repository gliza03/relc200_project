										<h1>Buddhism and the Renunciation of Family</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/buddfam2.png" alt="" /></span>

									<p>Unlike other religions, buddhism is not family-centered. Buddhism is centered on a monastic path that involves the renunciation of all familial tiesâ€”following the ideal model of the Buddha himself, who abandoned his parents, wife, and son in order to work toward the ultimate goal of Buddhahood. Thus, many Buddhist texts are characterized by a strong renunciatory and anti-family discourse in which the family is depicted as a primary source of attachment, delusion, and suffering.</p>
									<p>However, Buddhism relies on supporting each member of this community, sort of like a family. In practice, Buddhism supports family life by giving advice on how to be a family, promoting practices in favor of fertility and procreation, and promoting the idea that we need this religion in how we interact with our family and deceased ancestors.</p>

									<h2>The Five Precepts</h2>
									<p>Originally composed by the Buddha for families and laity not capable of adopting monasticism, the Five Precepts are binding ethical mandates promoting personal virtues. They are (1) abstaining from harming living beings; (2) abstaining from taking what is not given; (3) abstaining from sexual misconduct; (4) abstaining from false speech; and (5) abstaining from intoxicants. Although none of these precepts directly addresses the family, by governing social and interpersonal relationships they provide an ethical framework for family life.</p>
									<p>The emphasis within family life in Buddhist ethics rests upon the proper roles and responsibilities that characterize the husband-wife relationship and the parent-child relationship. Husbands and wives are to cultivate respect, honor, and faithfulness towards one another. Parents are responsible for inculcating Buddhist ethics and practices in their children and, in turn, children are expected to be obedient and to preserve the traditions of the family.</p>

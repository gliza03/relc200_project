										<h1>Family in Catholicism</h1>

									<p>For us Catholics, families are the foundations of society! Our nature as human beings is to have families and fill the world with more people. As God said, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth." Jesus was born in a family, with Mary and Joseph, and they loved and nurtured him. The fact that they raised him is why family is so important.</p>
									<p>"The Church considers the family as the first natural society. It is the foundation of society and is central to all social life. It is a place where different generations live together and experience affection, solidarity, appreciation, unselfish commitment, help and justice. Every person is loved, just as he is." - The Catholic Parlimentary Office.</p>

									<h2>Role of Fathers and Mothers</h2>
									<p>The role of parents is not as emphasized as it is in the LDS Church. It is mostly determined by culture and geographic location! However, the Catholic Church does emphasize principles and roles in its teachings. Mothers and fathers both have important roles to play in the domestic church, the church of the home.  “In God's eternal plan, woman is the one in whom the order of love in the created world of persons takes first root […] The dignity of woman is measured by the order of love, which is essentially the order of justice and charity” (Pope John Paul II, Mulieris Dignitatem, 29).</p>
									<p>Mothers provide nurturing care of their families, teach us how to pray, encourage and nurture spiritual growth and development, and are living examples of the meaning of sacrificial, self-giving love which is the genesis and source of an authentically feminine spirituality. This is because of the Virgin Mary's values and principles. A man becomes a man and a father by doing things that a father ought to do.  In revealing and in reliving on earth the very fatherhood of God, a man is called upon to ensure stability and harmony within the family. </p>
									<p>Both men and women are called upon to image God but “it is necessary that the man be fully aware that in their shared parenthood he owes a special debt to the woman. […] Women are more capable than men of paying attention to another person, and that the man—even though he shares in the parenting relationship—always remains outside the process of pregnancy and the baby's birth; in many ways he has to learn his own 'fatherhood' from the mother” (Pope John Paul II, Mulieris Dignitatem, 18).</p>

									<h2>Any official document(s)?</h2>
									<p>Instead of one official document (like the Family Proclamation), the Catholic Church has letters and documents written by Popes that discuss topics like family. Before, I quoted some extracts of Mulieris Dignitatem, a letter written by Pope John Paul II in 1988 that talked about marriage and the dignity of women. Another recognized document, also written by the same Pope, is called Familiaris Consortio. This document discusses the role of the Christian family in the modern world.</p>
